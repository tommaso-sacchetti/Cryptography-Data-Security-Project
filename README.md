# Cryptography-Data-Security-Project

Project for the UPV course Cryptography and Data Security.

The following project contains the implementation of some cryptography related algorithms from two family of problems:
* Integrity
* Cryptoanalysis

For the integrity part the algorithms implementated are:
* Rainbow Attack
* Yuval (with crc32 and MD5 truncated to the first 3/4 bits)

For the cryptoanalysis part the algorithms implementated are:
* for the computation of the discrete logarithm:
  * Baby step gian step
* for the integer factorization
  * Fermat
  * Pollard rho
  * Pollard p-1
